# Review_Phi-OTDR_Data_Processing

Review in English: The phase sensitive optical time-domain reflectometer ('-OTDR), or in some applications called distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), has been a popularly used technology for long-distance monitoring of vibrational signals in recent years. Since '-OTDR systems usually operate in complicated and dynamic environments, there have been multiple intrusion event signals and also numerous noise interferences, which have been a major stumbling block toward the system’s efficiency and effectiveness.Many studies have proposed different techniques to mitigate this problem mainly in '-OTDR setup upgrades and improvements in data processing techniques.Most recently, machine learning methods for event classifications in order to help identify and categorize intrusion events have become the heated spot. In this paper,we provide a review of recent technologies fromconventional machine learning algorithms to deep neural networks for event classifications aimed at increasing the recognition/classification accuracy and reducing nuisance alarm rates (NARs) in '-OTDR systems. We present a comparative analysis of the current classification methods and then evaluate their performance in terms of classification accuracy, NAR, precision, recall, identification time, and other parameters.

Review in Chinese: 相位敏感光时域反射仪（Ф-OTDR）由于具备监测范围广、灵敏度高等优点被广泛应用于周界安防等领域。近年来，研究者对其光学系统的改进使得传感距离更长、空间分辨率更高，需要处理的数据量大大增加，且环境噪声以及扰动类型多样性给Ф-OTDR的实际应用带来了挑战。为了提高系统对外部扰动的识别能力、减少系统误报率，研究者需要使用信号处理算法提高系统信号信噪比、使用更好的特征提取算法与分类算法。本文简要介绍了相位敏感光时域反射系统的原理，对应用于该系统的降噪算法进行了归纳，以特征域为根据分类总结了不同的特征提取算法，较详细地介绍了近年来使用的机器学习算法以及深度学习分类算法，对比了各种算法的优劣，并展望了未来该领域信号处理方法可能的发展方向。
