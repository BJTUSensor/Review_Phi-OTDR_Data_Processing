# Review_Phi-OTDR_Data_Processing

The phase sensitive optical time-domain reflectometer ('-OTDR), or in some applications called distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), has been a popularly used technology for long-distance monitoring of vibrational signals in recent years. Since '-OTDR systems usually operate in complicated and dynamic environments, there have been multiple intrusion event signals and also numerous noise interferences, which have been a major stumbling block toward the system’s efficiency and effectiveness.Many studies have proposed different techniques to mitigate this problem mainly in '-OTDR setup upgrades and improvements in data processing techniques.Most recently, machine learning methods for event classifications in order to help identify and categorize intrusion events have become the heated spot. In this paper,we provide a review of recent technologies fromconventional machine learning algorithms to deep neural networks for event classifications aimed at increasing the recognition/classification accuracy and reducing nuisance alarm rates (NARs) in '-OTDR systems. We present a comparative analysis of the current classification methods and then evaluate their performance in terms of classification accuracy, NAR, precision, recall, identification time, and other parameters.
